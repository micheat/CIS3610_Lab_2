            <h1>Welcome to Laguna Brava Ecotourism</h1>
            <p>
                Laguna Brava Ecotourism is an organization run by <em>local community members</em> based in Laguna Brava. Laguna Brava is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst">karstic lake</a> of incomparable beauty located in western Guatemala. Laguna Brava is located in a remote and highly underdeveloped region, so reaching and exploring the lake takes a mix of extreme adventure and intimate contact with nature. The lake beauty lies in the colours variety of its waters, which depends on the sun's position. Laguna Brava is also known as Yolnabaj by the region's inhabitants, which translates as "rough lake". Despite its name, the waters of Laguna Brava Laguna are so calm that they instantly awaken a deep feeling of peace.
